# Alumni Tracking System

The Alumni Tracking System is a web-based application designed for colleges to efficiently track their alumni. This application incorporates several essential features to facilitate seamless alumni management. The key functionalities of the system include:

**Alumni Registration:** The system enables alumni to register themselves, providing essential information such as name, email, and graduation details.

Profile Picture Upload: Alumni can easily upload and change their profile pictures, which are securely stored on Cloudinary for efficient management.

Profile Update: Alumni have the option to update their personal details, allowing them to keep their information up-to-date.

Alumni Search: The system provides a search functionality that allows the college to look up alumni based on specific criteria such as graduation year, department, and name.

Email Communication: The application integrates with SendGrid to enable the college to send important emails and updates to the alumni community.

Community Engagement: The system features a Community tab where alumni can share posts, like, and comment on each other's updates and achievements.

Password Management: Alumni can change their passwords and also request a password reset via email if needed, ensuring account security.

User Authentication: The system incorporates a robust login mechanism to ensure secure access, with each user required to authenticate themselves.

FAQ Section: An FAQ section is included, allowing alumni to ask questions, and the admin can provide answers for common inquiries.

JWT Token Authentication: To maintain the logged-in state of users, the application utilizes JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication.

This Alumni Tracking System aims to strengthen the bond between the college and its alumni, providing an efficient platform for communication, networking, and updates on alumni activities and achievements.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
